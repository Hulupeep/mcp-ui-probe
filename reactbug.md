  The Problem:

  1. UI-Probe's Element Detection Limitations: The ui-probe tool is having
  trouble detecting and clicking on the plan cards because:
    - The cards are likely <div> elements styled to look like clickable
  cards, not traditional buttons
    - The analyze_ui function only returns buttons, forms, inputs, and
  specific ARIA roles - it's NOT detecting these card elements as clickable
  items
    - When I try selectors like .relative.cursor-pointer or variations, they
   fail because ui-probe can't properly identify these custom card
  components
  2. The Click Selectors Are Failing: When I attempt:
    - selector: ".relative.cursor-pointer" - This clicks but doesn't
  properly select the plan
    - text: "Free Trial" - Fails because it's looking for button text, not
  card heading text
    - selector: "h3:has-text('Free Trial')" - Fails because ui-probe doesn't
   support this pseudo-selector syntax
  3. State Management Issue: Even when I successfully click on elements (as
  shown by some successful clicks), the JavaScript state isn't being updated
   properly to enable the "Continue to Signup" button. This suggests:
    - The onClick handler might require a specific event type or target
    - There might be React state that isn't updating when ui-probe simulates
   the click
    - The page might be using event delegation that ui-probe's click
  simulation doesn't trigger correctly
  4. The Flow Execution Fails: When using run_flow, it can't decompose the
  task properly because:
    - It doesn't recognize the card structure as a form or standard UI
  pattern
    - It tries to find elements by text that aren't in its recognized
  element types

  Why UI-Probe Can't Execute This:

  The fundamental issue is that ui-probe is designed for standard HTML forms
   and buttons, but this modern React app uses:
  - Custom card components with click handlers
  - State management that requires specific event propagation
  - Visual elements that aren't semantic HTML buttons/forms

  The tool successfully navigates pages and can click standard buttons (like
   "Login"), but fails with these custom interactive card components that
  don't follow traditional HTML patterns.

  Solution needed: UI Probe needs to be able to work with modern react apps , custom components and state management, as well as visual elements that arent sematic html buttons and forms. it should ai to help identify this.
