## Overview

UI-Probe transforms web testing from code-heavy scripts to simple English commands. Instead of writing complex selectors and test logic, you describe what you want to test.

### Traditional vs UI-Probe

**Traditional Testing:**
```javascript
// 20+ lines of brittle code
const email = await page.waitForSelector('#email-field-2024');
await email.type('test@example.com');
const password = await page.waitForSelector('input[type="password"]');
await password.type('Test123!');
const submit = await page.waitForSelector('.submit-btn-primary');
await submit.click();
// ... error handling, waiting, validation ...
```

**UI-Probe:**
```bash
# One line in Claude Code CLI
run_flow "Sign up at https://myapp.com/register"
```

## Step-by-Step Commands

### 1. Navigation Commands

#### navigate - Go to a webpage

**Purpose:** Opens a specific URL in the browser

**Syntax:**
```bash
navigate "<url>" [options]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Basic navigation
navigate "https://example.com"

# With custom wait condition
navigate "https://app.com" {"waitUntil": "networkidle"}

# Local development
navigate "http://localhost:3000"
```

**Options:**
- `waitUntil`: When to consider navigation complete
  - `"load"` - Page load event fired
  - `"domcontentloaded"` - DOM parsed
  - `"networkidle"` - No network activity for 500ms

### 2. Analysis Commands

#### analyze_ui - Understand page structure

**Purpose:** Scans the page and reports all interactive elements

**Syntax:**
```bash
analyze_ui "<url>" [options]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Analyze entire page
analyze_ui "https://example.com"

# Analyze just the visible viewport
analyze_ui "https://example.com" {"scope": "viewport"}

# Get detailed analysis
analyze_ui "https://example.com" {"detailed": true}
```

**Returns:**
- Forms with field names and types
- Buttons with labels and purposes
- Input fields with smart naming
- Links and navigation elements
- Interactive elements

**Sample Output:**
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Test Data

Override automatic data generation for specific test cases:

```bash
# Test with international data
fill_form "https://app.com/signup" {
  "email": "test@company.co.uk",
  "phone": "+44 20 7946 0958",
  "country": "United Kingdom",
  "postal_code": "SW1A 1AA"
}

# Test edge cases
fill_form "https://app.com/profile" {
  "name": "JosÃ© MarÃ­a de la Cruz",
  "email": "test+tag@sub.domain-with-hyphens.com"
}

# Test data limits
fill_form "https://app.com/form" {
  "description": "A".repeat(5000),  # Test max length
  "age": 150  # Test boundary
}
```

### Conditional Testing

Test different paths based on page state:

```bash
# Handle different states
run_flow "Go to https://shop.com, if sale banner exists click it, otherwise go to products page"

# A/B testing
run_flow "Visit https://app.com, if new design is shown test new signup flow, else test old flow"

# Feature flags
run_flow "Login to https://app.com, if beta features enabled test new dashboard"
```

### Performance Testing

Monitor timing while testing:

```bash
# Check page load time
navigate "https://app.com" {"measurePerformance": true}

# Time form submission
run_flow "Fill and submit form at https://app.com/contact and report how long it takes"

# Monitor multi-step flow
run_flow "Complete checkout at https://shop.com and measure total time"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Navigation failed" Error

**Problem:** Can't connect to the website

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Verify URL is correct and accessible
curl https://your-site.com

# 2. For local dev, ensure server is running
npm run dev  # in your project

# 3. Check if Playwright browsers are installed
cd ~/mcp-ui-probe && npx playwright install
```

#### "Element not found" Error

**Problem:** Can't find the element to interact with

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Analyze page to see what's available
analyze_ui "https://your-site.com"

# 2. Wait for dynamic content
wait_for "https://your-site.com" "Element text" "visible" 30

# 3. Be more specific
click "https://your-site.com" "Blue Submit button in the main form"
```

#### Form Not Filling Correctly

**Problem:** Custom dropdowns or special inputs

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Check what UI-Probe sees
analyze_ui "https://your-site.com/form"

# 2. Use click for custom dropdowns
click "https://site.com" "Country dropdown"
click "https://site.com" "United States option"

# 3. Use run_flow for complex interactions
run_flow "Click the date picker and select tomorrow's date"
```

#### Validation Errors Not Detected

**Problem:** Page shows errors but test passes

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Look for specific error text
assert_element "https://site.com" "Email is required" "visible"

# 2. Check for error classes
assert_element "https://site.com" ".error-message" "visible"

# 3. Analyze after submission
fill_form "https://site.com/form" {"email": "invalid"}
analyze_ui "https://site.com/form"  # See what changed
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Analysis
Always analyze before interacting:
```bash
analyze_ui "https://site.com/form"
# Review output, then:
fill_form "https://site.com/form" {}
```

### 2. Use Incremental Testing
Build complex tests gradually:
```bash
# First: Basic navigation
navigate "https://app.com"

# Then: Find elements
analyze_ui "https://app.com"

# Then: Simple interaction
click "https://app.com" "Login"

# Finally: Complete flow
run_flow "Complete login and verify dashboard at https://app.com"
```

### 3. Be Specific When Needed
```bash
# Vague (might click wrong element)
click "https://site.com" "Submit"

# Better (more specific)
click "https://site.com" "Submit button in registration form"

# Best (unambiguous)
click "https://site.com" "Blue Submit button below email field"
```

### 4. Test Both Happy and Error Paths
```bash
# Happy path
fill_form "https://app.com/login" {"email": "valid@example.com", "password": "Correct123!"}
assert_element "https://app.com/dashboard" "Welcome" "visible"

# Error path
fill_form "https://app.com/login" {"email": "valid@example.com", "password": "wrong"}
assert_element "https://app.com/login" "Invalid credentials" "visible"
```

### 5. Use Appropriate Waits
```bash
# For dynamic content
wait_for "https://app.com" "Loading..." "hidden"

# For async operations
fill_form "https://app.com/form" {}
wait_for "https://app.com" "Success" "visible" 10

# For animations
wait_for "https://app.com" ".modal" "visible" 5
```

## Testing Your Tests

### Using the Built-in Test Suite

UI-Probe includes test pages to verify functionality:

```bash
# Start test server (Terminal 1)
cd ~/mcp-ui-probe
npm run test:server

# Run tests (Terminal 2 - Claude Code CLI)
# Test form filling
analyze_ui "http://localhost:8080/test/forms"
fill_form "http://localhost:8080/test/forms" {}

# Test navigation
run_flow "Navigate through all pages at http://localhost:8080/test"

# Test validation
fill_form "http://localhost:8080/test/validation" {"email": "invalid"}
assert_element "http://localhost:8080/test/validation" "Invalid email" "visible"

# Test dynamic content
navigate "http://localhost:8080/test/dynamic"
wait_for "http://localhost:8080/test/dynamic" "Content loaded" "visible"
```

### Running the Full Test Suite

```bash
# In the mcp-ui-probe directory
npm test

# For specific tests
npm test -- --grep "form filling"

# With coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```
