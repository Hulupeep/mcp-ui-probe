# MCP UI-Probe Error Report - Chatbot Authentication Testing

## Test Date: September 23, 2025

## Executive Summary
Testing of the SimpleChat chatbot application revealed multiple issues with both the authentication flow and the MCP UI-Probe tool's ability to handle form submissions and error detection.

---

## Test Case 1: Initial Sign In Attempt

### Expected Results
- User navigates to Sign Up page (not Sign In)
- User successfully creates a new account
- User is redirected to dashboard or welcome page
- No errors displayed on screen

### Actual Results
- MCP incorrectly navigated to Sign In page instead of Sign Up initially
- JavaScript destructuring error displayed on login page: `Cannot destructure property 'error' of '(intermediate value)' as it is undefined.`
- Form submission succeeded technically but authentication failed
- No redirect occurred after form submission
- MCP failed to properly detect the on-screen error initially

### Errors Captured
1. **Console Errors:**
   - "Invalid or unexpected token"
   - "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)"

2. **Validation Error:**
   - Alert role element displayed: "Cannot destructure property 'error' of '(intermediate value)' as it is undefined."

## Test Case 2: Sign Up Form Submission

### Expected Results
- Navigate to Sign Up page successfully
- Fill all required fields (Business Name, Industry, Use Case, Email, Password, Confirm Password)
- Submit form successfully
- Create new user account
- Redirect to dashboard

### Actual Results
- Successfully navigated to Sign Up page (http://localhost:3000/auth/signup)
- Form filling partially failed:
  - Business Name: ✅ Filled with "demo127"
  - Industry dropdown: ❌ Failed - "Element is not an <input>, <textarea> or [contenteditable] element"
  - Use Case dropdown: ❌ Failed - Same error
  - Email: ❌ Not attempted due to previous failures
  - Password: ❌ Not attempted
  - Confirm Password: ❌ Not attempted
- Form submission not completed due to field filling errors
- Test execution timed out after 30 seconds

### Technical Issues Identified

1. **MCP UI-Probe Limitations:**
   - Cannot properly handle `<select>` dropdown elements
   - Attempts to use `.clear()` method on non-input elements
   - Poor error detection - did not initially identify the JavaScript error as a blocking issue
   - Incorrectly reported page as "OK" when critical errors were present

2. **Application Issues:**
   - JavaScript error in authentication flow: Attempting to destructure undefined values
   - Missing or misconfigured Supabase authentication backend
   - Form validation not properly handling edge cases

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### MCP UI-Probe Issues:
1. **Dropdown Handling:** The tool cannot properly interact with `<select>` elements, trying to clear them like text inputs
2. **Error Detection:** The tool's error detection is insufficient - it doesn't properly capture runtime JavaScript errors displayed to users
3. **Intent Recognition:** Tool misunderstood "sign up" vs "sign in" initially

### Application Issues:
1. **Authentication Backend:** The Supabase authentication appears to be misconfigured or not running
2. **Error Handling:** The application doesn't gracefully handle authentication failures
3. **Form Implementation:** The sign-up form may have accessibility or compatibility issues

---

## Recommendations

### For MCP UI-Probe Development:
1. Implement proper handling for `<select>` dropdown elements
2. Enhance error detection to capture all visible error messages and JavaScript runtime errors
3. Improve intent recognition for common authentication flows
4. Add better timeout handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Implement screenshot capture for visual error documentation

### For Application Development:
1. Fix the JavaScript destructuring error in the authentication handler
2. Ensure Supabase backend is properly configured and running
3. Add proper error boundaries and user-friendly error messages
4. Validate all form fields are properly accessible

## Test Metrics

- **Total Test Duration:** ~2 minutes
- **Success Rate:** 20% (1 of 5 main tasks completed successfully)
- **Errors Encountered:** 5 distinct errors
- **Forms Analyzed:** 2 (Sign In and Sign Up)
- **Fields Successfully Filled:** 1 of 6 attempted

---

## Conclusion

The MCP UI-Probe tool shows promise but requires significant improvements in form handling, especially for complex elements like dropdowns. Additionally, the tool needs better error detection capabilities to identify and report JavaScript runtime errors that are visible to users but not necessarily 404 or network errors.

The chatbot application itself has authentication configuration issues that need to be resolved before successful user registration can occur.
