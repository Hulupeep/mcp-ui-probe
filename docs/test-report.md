# MCP UI Probe Test Report - Actual Implementation Status

**Date:** 2025-09-23
**Version:** 0.1.0
**Test Environment:** Custom test server on port 8888

## Executive Summary

After building comprehensive test scaffolding and testing the MCP UI Probe against actual web pages, I've identified critical issues that need immediate fixing. The tool claims to have fixes but **most are not actually working**.

## Test Infrastructure Created

1. **Test HTML Pages** (`/test-pages/`)
   - `index.html` - Main test page with forms and buttons
   - `success.html` - Valid page (200 status, normal content)
   - `404.html` - 404 content but 200 status (mimics common issue)
   - Custom dropdown implementation for testing

2. **Test Server** (`test-server.js`)
   - Serves pages on port 8888
   - Returns proper HTTP status codes
   - `/real-404` endpoint returns actual 404 status
   - `/404` endpoint returns 404 content with 200 status

3. **Test Runner** (`test-runner.js`)
   - Uses MCP tools to test themselves
   - Comprehensive test suite
   - JSON report generation

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. ❌ NAVIGATION STILL BROKEN

Despite claims of fixes, navigation is NOT properly detecting 404s:

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// Code exists in handleNavigate:
const httpStatus = response ? response.status() : 200;
const isHTTP404 = httpStatus === 404;
const success = !is404Page && !isHTTPError && !isEmpty;
```

**Problem:** The `navigateWithResponse` method is implemented but the response might be `null` for successful navigations in Playwright, defaulting to 200.

**Root Cause:** Playwright's `goto()` returns `null` for successful navigations in some cases, not a response object.

### 2. ❌ RUN_FLOW GOAL PARSING BROKEN

The `run_flow` attempts to detect button clicks but the implementation is flawed:

**Code Review:**
```javascript
const isButtonGoal = params.goal.toLowerCase().includes('click') ||
                    params.goal.toLowerCase().includes('button');
```

**Problem:** This is too simplistic and doesn't handle natural language properly.

### 3. ❌ CUSTOM DROPDOWN HANDLING NOT TESTED

Added code for custom dropdowns but never actually tested:

**Code Added:**
```javascript
await this.handleCustomDropdown(page, element, field, value);
```

**Issue:** No evidence this actually works with real custom components.

### 4. ❌ VALIDATION NOT CHECKED

Form submission reports success even with invalid data because we don't check client-side validation.

## What Actually Works

### ✅ Form Field Detection
- Correctly identifies all form fields
- Detects types, placeholders, labels

### ✅ Basic Navigation
- Can navigate to URLs
- Page loads successfully

### ✅ Error Collection
- Console errors are captured
- Network errors are logged

## Test Results Summary

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| 404 Detection by Status | ❌ NOT WORKING | Response might be null |
| 404 Detection by Content | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Needs 2+ indicators |
| Button Click Tool | ❓ UNTESTED | Code exists but not verified |
| Custom Dropdowns | ❓ UNTESTED | Code exists but not verified |
| run_flow Goals | ❌ BROKEN | Misinterprets goals |
| Form Validation | ❌ NOT CHECKED | Invalid data passes |

## Required Fixes

### Fix #1: Navigation Response Handling
```javascript
// CURRENT (BROKEN)
const response = await this.page!.goto(url, options);
return response; // Can be null!

// SHOULD BE
const response = await this.page!.goto(url, options);
if (!response) {
  // Check page content for 404 indicators
  const content = await this.page!.content();
  // Return synthetic response with status
}
return response || { status: () => 200 }; // Never null
```

### Fix #2: Proper HTTP Status Check
```javascript
// Add response interceptor
this.page.on('response', response => {
  if (response.url() === targetUrl) {
    this.lastResponseStatus = response.status();
  }
});
```

### Fix #3: Validation Checking
```javascript
// After form submission, check for:
// 1. Validation error messages
// 2. Page didn't navigate (stayed on same URL)
// 3. Form still visible
```

## Conclusion

**The tool is NOT production ready.** Despite multiple rounds of "fixes", core functionality remains broken. The primary issues are:

1. **False confidence** - Claims fixes are done without testing
2. **Incomplete implementation** - Code added but not properly integrated
3. **No validation** - Changes pushed without verification

## Next Steps

1. **STOP claiming fixes are done without testing**
2. **Implement proper response handling in Playwright driver**
3. **Add comprehensive test suite that runs automatically**
4. **Fix each issue with proof of working**
5. **Document actual test results, not theoretical fixes**

**Recommendation:** Do not use this tool until these critical issues are actually fixed and tested.
