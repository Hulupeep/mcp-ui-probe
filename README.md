# UI-Probe: Test Any Website in Plain English

## The Problem

Website testing is broken. You write hundreds of lines of code that breaks the moment a developer changes a button class from `btn-primary` to `button-primary`. Your tests fail not because the app is broken, but because someone moved a div or renamed an ID.

## The Solution

**UI-Probe** is an **assistant-first, Claude/MCP-native web app tester**.

UI-Probe lets you test websites by describing what you want to do in plain English. No code. No selectors. Just describe it like you'd tell a human.

## ⚡ Not the First, But a Different Take

Tools like **Testim**, **Mabl**, and **Rainforest QA** already bring codeless/AI testing to market. They’re powerful, but often **enterprise-heavy, SaaS-locked, and tuned for QA engineers**.

**UI-Probe takes a different path:**

- **Assistant-first** → Runs natively inside Claude via MCP. You just talk to your assistant and watch it work.
- **Plain English by default** → No scripts, no recorders. Just tell it what you want tested.
- **Beginner-friendly** → PMs, designers, and non-devs can use it right away.
- **Open-source + lightweight** → Clone, run, hack. No vendor lock-in.
- **From testing → to doing** → Today: check your web flows. Tomorrow: actually run them.

### From Testing → to Doing

UI-Probe doesn’t stop at testing. The same way you say:

- “✅ Test if users can sign up”

…you can also say:

- “✅ Actually sign me up for an account”
- “✅ Buy a blue shirt from the shop”
- “✅ Order me a ham + mustard sandwich from sandwich.com and deliver it”

So what starts as a **QA helper** can also become your **personal web agent** — able to test, repeat, and even perform real tasks for you.

UI Probe is not just testing — it's a **universal intention layer for the web**  made simple.

### What Makes UI-Probe Different

- **Built-in test playground** - Test pages included to try before deploying to your project
- **Real-time monitoring** - Watch tests run with live feedback
- **Claude-native** - Designed specifically for Claude Code CLI, not retrofitted
- **Actually works for non-devs** - PMs, designers, QA can use it immediately
- **Open source** - No vendor lock-in, customize as needed
- **Semantic AI Resolution** - Smart hybrid that uses Playwright's semantic selectors first, then falls back to LLM intelligence only when needed. This means your tests find "Technology" checkboxes even when `value="tech"`, without burning API calls on simple matches

```bash
# Instead of this nightmare:
await driver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[@id='login-form']//input[@name='email']")).sendKeys("test@example.com");
await driver.findElement(By.css(".btn-submit.primary")).click();

# Just say this:
run_flow "Sign up for an account"
```

## For Complete Beginners

Never written code? Perfect! UI-Probe is designed for you:

1. **Install it** (one-time setup, 5 minutes)
2. **Tell it what to test** in plain English
3. **Get clear results** - "✅ Account created" or "❌ The signup button is hidden"

### Example for Non-Developers

Want to test your website's contact form every day? Just type:

```bash
# In Claude, you can be natural:
"Test the contact form on my homepage"

# Claude figures out the URL from context, or you can be explicit:
fill_form "https://mysite.com/contact" {"message": "Testing!"}
```

That's it. No programming required.

## For Developers

UI-Probe gives you:
- **Self-healing tests** - Automatically adapts when UI changes
- **80% less code** - One line instead of dozens
- **AI-powered intelligence** - Uses GPT-4/Claude to understand pages
- **Clear error messages** - "Button is hidden by cookie banner" vs "ElementNotInteractableException"

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ ([Download](https://nodejs.org) - just click "Next" through installer)
- Claude Code CLI or any terminal

### System Requirements
- **OS**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
- **Disk Space**: ~500MB for Playwright browsers (one-time download)
- **RAM**: 2GB minimum, 4GB recommended

### Option 1: Use with npx (Easiest - Works Everywhere!)

**Two quick steps:**
1. ✅ **Test the tool** (works immediately)
2. 🔧 **Connect to Claude** (one-time setup)

#### Step 1: Test UI-Probe Right Now
```bash
# No installation needed! Just run:
npx mcp-ui-probe setup         # First time only - installs Playwright browsers
npx mcp-ui-probe test-server   # Start test playground (visit http://localhost:8081/test)
npx mcp-ui-probe start         # Start MCP server (for testing the protocol)
```

#### Step 2: Connect to Claude (One-Time Setup)

**Why this extra step?** Claude Code CLI can't find `npx` by itself because it doesn't have access to your shell's PATH. You need to tell Claude exactly where npx is located on your computer.

**Option A: Automatic Setup (Easiest - does everything for you):**
```bash
# This script will:
# 1. Find where npx is installed on your computer
# 2. Add UI-Probe to Claude with the correct path
# 3. Verify everything is configured properly
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hulupeep/mcp-ui-probe/main/scripts/claude-setup.sh | bash
```

After running this, just restart Claude and UI-Probe will be ready to use!

**Option B: Manual Setup (if automatic doesn't work):**

**Step 1: Find your npx path**
```bash
# On macOS/Linux:
which npx
# Example output: /usr/local/bin/npx or ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.11.0/bin/npx

# On Windows:
where npx
# Example output: C:\Program Files\nodejs\npx.cmd
```

**Step 2: Add to Claude with the full path**
```bash
# Use YOUR path from Step 1:
claude mcp add ui-probe "/full/path/to/npx" "mcp-ui-probe@latest" "start"

# Real examples:
# Standard Node:
claude mcp add ui-probe "/usr/local/bin/npx" "mcp-ui-probe@latest" "start"

# Using NVM:
claude mcp add ui-probe "$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v22.11.0/bin/npx" "mcp-ui-probe@latest" "start"

# Windows:
claude mcp add ui-probe "C:\Program Files\nodejs\npx.cmd" "mcp-ui-probe@latest" "start"
```

**Step 3: Restart Claude Code CLI**

The MCP server will be available next time you start Claude Code.

### Option 2: Install from Source

```bash
# Clone it (this downloads the code)
git clone https://github.com/Hulupeep/mcp-ui-probe.git
cd mcp-ui-probe

# Install it (this sets everything up)
npm install

# CRITICAL: Install browsers (one-time, takes 2-3 minutes)
npx playwright install

# Add to Claude:
claude mcp add ui-probe "node" "/path/to/mcp-ui-probe/dist/index.js"
```

### Step 3: Enable AI (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# In the mcp-ui-probe folder
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env
```

This makes UI-Probe smarter at understanding your commands.

### Step 4: Test Something!

```bash
# In Claude, just describe what you want:
"Test if users can sign up on example.com"

# Or be specific:
run_flow "Go to https://example.com/signup and create an account"
```

## How URLs Work in Claude

Claude is smart about URLs:

```bash
# Natural language - Claude figures it out:
"Test the login on my homepage"
"Check if the contact form works"
"Sign up for a new account"

# Explicit - when you need a specific URL:
navigate "https://staging.myapp.com/login"
fill_form "https://myapp.com/contact" {"message": "Hi!"}
```

**Tip:** Start natural. If Claude asks "What URL?", then be specific.

## Common Tasks

### Test a Login Form
```bash
# Natural way:
"Test if users can log in"

# Explicit way:
run_flow "Go to https://myapp.com/login, enter test@example.com and password123, click login"
```

### Test a Purchase
```bash
# Natural:
"Buy a blue shirt from the shop"

# Explicit:
run_flow "Go to https://shop.com, search for blue shirt, add first result to cart, checkout with test card 4111111111111111"
```

### Test Form Validation
```bash
# Test what happens with bad data:
fill_form "https://myapp.com/signup" {"email": "not-an-email"}
# UI-Probe tells you: "❌ Email validation error appeared"
```

### Check if Something Exists
```bash
assert_element "https://myapp.com" "Free shipping" "visible"
# Returns: "✅ Found 'Free shipping' on page"
```

## What Makes UI-Probe Different

### Traditional Testing Tools
- Write code with specific selectors
- Tests break when UI changes
- Cryptic error messages
- Need programming knowledge
- Hundreds of lines of code

### UI-Probe
- Describe in plain English
- Self-healing when UI changes
- Clear, human-friendly errors
- No programming needed
- One line does it all

## Real-World Examples

### E-commerce Site
```bash
# Complete purchase flow
"Buy the cheapest laptop on the site"

# UI-Probe automatically:
# - Finds the shop
# - Searches for laptops
# - Sorts by price
# - Adds to cart
# - Fills checkout
# - Completes purchase
```

### SaaS Application
```bash
# Test free trial signup
"Sign up for a free trial with a company email"

# UI-Probe:
# - Navigates to signup
# - Detects it's a business form
# - Fills company fields
# - Uses appropriate test data
# - Verifies trial activated
```

### Banking App
```bash
# Test money transfer
"Transfer $50 from checking to savings"

# UI-Probe:
# - Logs in securely
# - Navigates to transfers
# - Fills amount
# - Selects accounts
# - Confirms transfer
```

## Built-in Test Playground

UI-Probe includes a comprehensive test playground to try before deploying to your project:

```bash
# Start the test server (runs on port 8081)
npm run test:server

# Visit http://localhost:8081/test in your browser to see the playground
```

### Available Test Pages:

- **Main Test Page** (`/test`) - Complete sign-up form with validation
- **Forms Testing** (`/test/forms`) - Every input type (text, select, radio, checkbox, etc.)
- **Navigation Testing** (`/test/navigation`) - Multi-page navigation and routing
- **Dynamic Content** (`/test/dynamic`) - JavaScript-driven UI updates
- **Validation Scenarios** (`/test/validation`) - Error handling and edge cases

### Test in Claude:

```bash
# Analyze form structure
analyze_ui "http://localhost:8081/test/forms"

# Fill and submit forms
fill_form "http://localhost:8081/test/forms" {"firstName": "John", "email": "john@example.com"}

# Run complete flows
run_flow(goal="Sign up as new user", url="http://localhost:8081/test")

## Configuration

### Basic (.env file)
```bash
# Make UI-Probe smarter
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# See the browser window
HEADLESS=false

# Show detailed logs
DEBUG=true
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# Timeout for slow sites (milliseconds)
TIMEOUT=60000

# Retry failed operations
MAX_RETRIES=5

# Take screenshots on failure
SCREENSHOT_ON_FAILURE=true
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to connect" or "Connection failed" in Claude Code CLI

**Problem:** Claude shows ui-probe as "failed" or can't connect when you run `claude mcp list`.

**Solution:** Claude Code CLI needs the full path to npx, not just "npx".

1. **Find your npx location:**
   ```bash
   which npx  # Mac/Linux
   where npx  # Windows
   ```

2. **Remove the broken configuration:**
   ```bash
   claude mcp remove ui-probe
   ```

3. **Add with the full path:**
   ```bash
   # Use YOUR actual path from step 1
   claude mcp add ui-probe "/path/from/step1/npx" "mcp-ui-probe@latest" "start"
   ```

4. **Start a new Claude Code session**
   ```bash
   claude  # The MCP server will now connect properly
   ```

**Common npx locations:**
- Standard Node.js: `/usr/local/bin/npx`
- NVM (Node Version Manager): `~/.nvm/versions/node/vXX.XX.X/bin/npx`
- Homebrew (Mac): `/opt/homebrew/bin/npx`
- Windows: `C:\Program Files\nodejs\npx.cmd`

### "Port already in use" when starting test server

**Solution:** Use a different port:
```bash
npx mcp-ui-probe test-server --port 3000
```

### "Navigation failed"
The site can't be reached. Check:
1. Is the URL correct?
2. Is the site running? (for localhost)
3. Run `npx playwright install` (if you haven't)

### "Element not found"
The button/form/link isn't there. Try:
1. `analyze_ui "URL"` to see what's on the page
2. `wait_for "URL" "element" "visible"` for slow-loading content
3. Be more specific: "the blue submit button" vs just "submit"

### Form won't fill
Custom form elements. Try:
1. `analyze_ui` to see what UI-Probe detects
2. Use `click` for custom dropdowns
3. Use `run_flow` for complex interactions

## Smart Features

### Automatic Test Data
UI-Probe generates appropriate test data:
- Valid emails that pass validation
- Strong passwords that meet requirements
- Phone numbers in the right format
- Realistic names and addresses
- Test credit cards (4111111111111111)

### Self-Healing Tests
When developers change:
- Class names → UI-Probe still finds the button
- IDs → Still works
- Page structure → Adapts automatically
- Text labels → Understands context

### Clear Error Messages
```
❌ Traditional: "WebDriverException: unknown error: Element is not clickable at point (780, 532)"

✅ UI-Probe: "The submit button is hidden behind a cookie consent banner. Try dismissing the banner first."
```

## Comparison with playwright-mcp

### Quick Summary

**UI-Probe** and **playwright-mcp** are complementary tools, not competitors:

- **playwright-mcp**: Low-level infrastructure tool providing primitive browser commands for AI agents
- **UI-Probe**: High-level testing application with plain English interface for end users

### Key Differences

| Aspect | playwright-mcp | UI-Probe |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Target User** | Developers building AI agents | Non-technical users (PMs, designers, QA) |
| **Interface** | Element-based (`browser_click`, `browser_type`) | Intent-based (`run_flow "Sign up"`) |
| **Self-Healing** | No - breaks if DOM changes | Yes - uses AI to adapt to changes |
| **Test Data** | User must provide | Auto-generates valid data |
| **Setup** | Single npx command | Clone repo + npm install |

### The Bottom Line

- Use **playwright-mcp** if you're a developer building an AI agent that needs browser control
- Use **UI-Probe** if you want to test websites without writing code

Think of playwright-mcp as the engine and UI-Probe as the user-friendly car built around it.
